SECTION 6 — Security & Safeguarding

Client payroll funds are:
 • Held in segregated safeguarded UK bank accounts
 • Used solely for payroll processing
 • Never deployed, invested, or lent
 • Reconciled and monitored daily

Operational resilience comes first. Always.

Payroll is trust infrastructure — and we treat it that way.
