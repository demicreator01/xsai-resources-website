SECTION 3 — The Loyalty Credit Programme

Payroll funds are typically received several days before employees are paid. This is standard industry practice.

Within that operational window, safeguarded client accounts may generate treasury benefit at bank level.

Most providers retain this entirely.

We take a different approach.

Through our Loyalty Credit Programme, we allocate a portion of operational treasury benefit back to qualifying partners — as credits that can be:
 • Applied against future invoices
 • Redeemed
 • Used toward additional services

No investment exposure.
No lending activity.
No risk deployment.

Just operational efficiency — shared fairly.
